# niuma-engine

> **An engineering-discipline framework for AI coding agents: reusable rules and adapters, not an agent runtime.**

English · [中文](README.md) · [Capabilities](docs/capabilities.md) · [Install](docs/agent-install.md) · [Compatibility](docs/compatibility.md) · [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)

niuma-engine turns recurring failure modes in AI-assisted development—blind file overwrites, weak verification, suspicious metrics, multi-agent conflicts, and repeated dead ends—into reviewable Markdown rules and agent-integration guidance.

## What it is / is not

| It is | It is not |
|---|---|
| 34 composable engineering-discipline rules | An executable agent runtime, CLI, or background service |
| A Claude Code rules directory plus integration guidance for Codex, Cursor, Aider, and Gemini CLI | A plug-in that automatically creates backups, schedules jobs, or merges branches |
| An open framework for discussing and improving AI engineering workflows | Prompt magic that makes a model smarter |

See [Capabilities](docs/capabilities.md) for the boundary between shipped assets, reference architectures, and automation that you must implement in your own environment.

## Try it in 3 minutes: prevent blind overwrites

For Claude Code, install one minimal rule in a test project:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Destined-at-Dawn/niuma-engine.git
mkdir -p YOUR_PROJECT/.claude/rules
cp niuma-engine/.claude/rules/no-blind-overwrite.md YOUR_PROJECT/.claude/rules/
```

Start a new agent session and ask it to modify an existing file. It should read the file first and describe the planned change before writing. The [installation guide](docs/agent-install.md) includes verification steps, Windows commands, and setup instructions for other agents.

> This is a rules framework. Actual behavior depends on the tool, project configuration, and your final review. Test it in a disposable project before adopting it for important work.

## Choose rules by pain point

| Pain point | Start with |
|---|---|
| AI may overwrite or delete existing files | `no-blind-overwrite.md`, `script-safety-check.md` |
| AI reports implausibly good numbers | `anti-illusion-audit.md` |
| AI says “done” without enough verification | `10-engineering-laws.md`, `lifecycle-sop.md` |
| The same failure keeps recurring | `negative-results.md` |
| Multiple agents conflict | `agent-prompt-ironclad.md`, `subagent-strategy.md` |
| You want the full rule set | `.claude/rules/` (34 rule files) |

## Support status

| Agent | Integration | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/rules/` | Primary target |
| Codex | `AGENTS.md` plus copied rules | Integration example provided |
| Cursor | `.cursor/rules` | Integration guidance provided |
| Aider | `.aider.conf.yml` | Integration guidance provided |
| Gemini CLI | `GEMINI.md` | Integration guidance provided |

“Integration guidance provided” is not a guarantee of continuous compatibility. Check the [compatibility matrix](docs/compatibility.md) for scope and limitations.
